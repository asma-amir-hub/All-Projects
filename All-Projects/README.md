The Octagon Oracle is not just a data dashboard; it's an end-to-end machine learning application designed to predict the outcomes of UFC fights with high accuracy. The platform leverages a high-volume web scraping pipeline, a sophisticated feature engineering factory, and an explainable AI (XAI) model to provide deep, data-driven insights for fight fans, analysts, and bettors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Data Science Pipeline: A Look Under the Hood

The power of this application comes from its robust, multi-stage data science pipeline.

**1. Data Acquisition Engine (Scraping)**
   - The process begins by ingesting a master list of over 77,000 fight URLs.
   - A **parallelized Python scraper** is deployed to scrape data from three pages for each fight (the main fight stats page and one for each of the two fighters), totaling over 230,000 web pages.
   - The raw HTML is parsed using BeautifulSoup to extract hundreds of raw data points, which are then saved to CSV files.

**2. The Feature Factory (Cleaning & Engineering)**
   - Raw data is meticulously cleaned, with text values converted to numerics and missing stats intelligently imputed.
   - This is where the magic happens. We engineer a powerful set of features designed to compare fighters directly:
     - **Differential Features:** `Age_diff`, `Reach_diff`, `SLpM_diff`, `TD_Accuracy_diff`.
     - **Historical & Performance Features:** `Current_Win_Streak`, `Finish_Rate`, `Avg_Fight_Time_in_Last_3_Fights`.
   - The final, processed dataset is a rich tabular file ready for modeling.

**3. The Prediction Core (XGBoost & SHAP)**
   - An **XGBoost Classifier** is trained on the feature-engineered dataset to predict the winner. The model is fine-tuned for optimal performance.
   - A **SHAP Explainer** is trained alongside the model. This allows us to pass any single fight through the explainer to generate a force plot, visually breaking down the factors that pushed the prediction towards one fighter or the other.

## üìã Setup and Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the entire application locally.

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/octagon-oracle.git
    cd octagon-oracle
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows (PowerShell)
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install all required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Phase 2: Running the Data Pipeline
> **Warning:** The scraping process is resource-intensive and will take several hours to complete. It will generate several gigabytes of raw data.

1.  **Run the Web Scraper:** This script will scrape all 230,000+ pages.
    ```bash
    python backend/scraper.py
    ```
2.  **Run the Data Processor:** This script cleans the raw data and engineers the features.
    ```bash
    python backend/data_processor.py
    ```
3.  **Train the ML Model:** This script trains the XGBoost model and SHAP explainer and saves them.
    ```bash
    python backend/model_trainer.py
    ```

### Phase 3: Launching the Web Application
1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory and run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run frontend/app.py
    ```
2.  Your web browser will automatically open a new tab with the **Octagon Oracle** application running live.
